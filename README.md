# Quiffen (WIP)
Quiffen is a Python package for parsing QIF (Quicken Interchange Format) files.

The package will allow users to both read QIF files and interact with the contents, and also to create a QIF structure
and then output to either a QIF file, a CSV of transaction data or a pandas DataFrame.
